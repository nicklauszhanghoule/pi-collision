# pi-collision
Approximating Pi with elastic collisions between two masses and a wall of infinite mass, along a frictionless surface, in whichh the total number of collisions between the masses and the walls correspond to the digits of Pi.

Future updates include user inputs for m1, m2 and realtime graphs
